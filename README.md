# WanderBe

## About
Welcome to WanderBe, a website designed to hold all your travel plans in one accesible place!

This project was created with the inspiration of being able to travel again after the Covid pandemic is over. Being a big travler, I wanted to be able to save all my travel plans in one area. WanderBe allows me to do that and more! Now I have the oppurtunity to save destinations and activities, along with cool resources accesible one click away.
